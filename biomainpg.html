                    <br>
                    <p1>Owner & Founder</p1>

                    <p>Aimun Sajid is the passionate owner and founder of UOH Sugarland Cafeteria. With over a five years of experience in the culinary industry, Aimun's love for food and hospitality inspired her to establish a cafeteria that offers delicious meals and a welcoming atmosphere. From a young age, I was enchanted by the kitchen's energy, where family recipes were passed down through generations and meals were more than sustenance; they were celebrations of culture and community. This early immersion in the culinary world ignited a passion in me to explore the vast tapestry of global cuisines, leading me on a journey across the world's kitchens, from the rustic trattorias of Italy to the bustling street food stalls of Pakistan.
